I joined BeerLamp, a small startup based in Charlottesville, VA in October 2015. They brought me on to help get the Android
version of their app released. When I started, there was already a large codebase to get acquainted with. I primarily fixed
bugs and finished incomplete features, but I also completed some features in their entirety. I mostly worked with one other
person, the head iOS developer, on this project.<br><br>
I learned a lot at BeerLamp; about working on a team and Android Development itself. The app is now available on the Google Play Store for free.
