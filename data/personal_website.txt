I created this website to be a portfolio for myself; not only to promote my skills and projects, but also to demonstrate my front-end web development abilities with HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery, as well as my back-end skills with PHP and MySQL. This website started out being completely static using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It has morphed over time to being more dynamic first with the use of just Javascript and JQuery. Today, it is fully dynamic in the back-end with PHP and MySQL. It is hosted on a single Raspberry Pi Apache server, which was set up and is administered by myself. It has been a great learning experience to completely build and manage every aspect of a website from the ground up. I will continue to improve it as I learn even more about web development over time.
